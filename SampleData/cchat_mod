I reached early. Took a bus and then walked. Reached office and no one was there. Then some people came in.
They tried pronouncing my name and then said they had decided to call me vini. So vini it is. I said Vinayaka means the *Lord of all* so I am now Lord vini.
The cto came and he said we want this this this. I said this and this will take a long time the scope is huge. So he said let's begin and then see.
They took all details for payroll.
Took me to a kick ass steak place where I had some slow cooked pork. Amazing it was. Then they took me to best buy and bought a Mac for the work to be done on.
I am freaking out aa some of the work is setup and I haven't done it earlier. And the app itself is vast to test. But yeah we shall see.
I borrowed the cto's bike to come back home, man I thought I'll die before I reached home. The rules are so weird here.
Reached home after 40 minutes of uphill cycling.
..my bad 😅
Tells to all his ten heads..Kamino ! 😡

It's called hogs eye. It's a trailer park and it looked amazing. People Get their trailers park it here and party and go back.
Then the walk was 20 minutes to the gurudwara. I walked on the highway to reach it, only to realise it is closed and there is no access to the building. I could see nobody there. It was strange. And all the properties around had board, no trespassing.
*Your life ain't worth what I have. Donr trespass. *

She was asked to delete some files, like
C\abc\a3s.pdf
C\abc\a2s.pdf
C\abc\a1s.pdf etc
She copied
C\ to some 100 lines, and started appending the file names to that.
I think she forgot to remove one of those c\
And deleted the whole partition. This was in production for the bank. Amex. Well, shit storm.
They had to manually load some back up tapes to restore the lost data.
Now you know how debts get deleted.

As he's walking he comes up on a young boy, maybe 12 years old, crying on the edge of the dock.
Mr. Smith hesitates but decides to ask what's wrong.
The boy wipes away his tears and replies, "Oh, there's just a lot of things going wrong in my life right now. I'm sorry if I bothered you."
Mr. Smith takes note of the boy's politeness, "Is there anything I can do to help? Why don't you tell me what's going on..."
With that the boy breaks down and sobs.
He starts going on and on about his troubles.
His mother is dying of cancer and can't work.
They can't afford the medicine to manage her symptoms.
They haven't eaten in days.
Not even an hour ago the boy had been caught dumpster diving behind a restaurant for food and was caned by the owner.
He tried to go home to his mother but when he got there he saw an eviction notice on the door and he just couldn't bring himself to go inside and give her the news.
Everything was just falling apart and he couldn't take it.
Mr. Smith was shocked.
Of all the people he could have encountered he encountered this boy.
He could solve this boy's problems with a single check.
But Mr. Smith was a firm believer in earning what you got no matter what it was.
As the boy continued to cry, Mr. Smith looked out to the water...
Johnny was awestruck. "You really mean it?"
Johnny dove into the water without a word and swam like a madman.
Mr. Smith watched with a smile on his face but his smile faded when Johnny turned around and came back.
When Johnny reached the dock he explained he got too tired too quickly and knew he wouldn't make it.
Well that's ok, Johnny. Tomorrow let's meet here, same time, and you can try again.
The next day they met and Johnny tried but once again he got fatigued and had to turn back.
Mr. Smith asked him if he'd eaten anything and Johnny told him he hadn't.
With that, Mr. Smith gave him some money for a small meal and told him tomorrow was his last day in town so if he was going to succeed it had to be then.
The next day Mr. Smith arrived and Johnny was waiting at the dock with a smile on his face. "You all fed and ready?" Mr. Smith asked.
And Johnny dove into the water.
This time he was swimming a bit slower.
He seemed to be pacing himself. Mr. Smith watched Johnny get further and further and his smile grew and grew.
What a perfect end to a perfect trip.
He was going to make a difference in this boy's life.
Johnny made it to the ship.
Mr. Smith watched him climb up the mast.
Johnny held on with one hand and reached the other out and started to wave victoriously but suddenly he lost his grip!
Johnny slipped and fell from the top of the mast all the way down to the ship below with a loud thud that echoed in the distance...
But Johnny was ok, know why?
...
...
...
...
...
He was used to hardships...
it will be good to see you all though
I am in

Varamahalakshmi Vrata is performed by married woman for the well being of all the family members, especially husband, to get progeny etc. It is believed that worshiping Goddess Varalakshmi on this day is equivalent to worshiping Ashtalaksmi – the eight goddesses of Wealth, Earth, Learning, Love, Fame, Peace, Pleasure, and Strength. Because of the popularity in some states of India, it is declared as an optional official holiday in India

Anecdote for no use
Why would Serena want to say such a thing? She is a good tennis player, but why compare between the sexes. Its just sexist on her part.

I asked him, why you do this macha, he said, he was interested in entrepreneurial ventures and didn't want to do research.
So he started his own business.
