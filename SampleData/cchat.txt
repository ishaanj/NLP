5/2/17, 10:27 AM - Vinayaka: For those who haven't heard, Washington State recently passed two laws. They legalized gay marriage and legalized marijuana. The fact that gay marriage and marijuana were legalized on the same day makes perfect Biblical sense. 

Leviticus 20:13 says: 
If a man lies with another man they should be stoned." 

Apparently we just hadn't interpreted it correctly before!

They tried pronouncing my name and then said they had decided to call me vini. So vini it is. I said Vinayaka means the *Lord of all* so I am now Lord vini. 

The cto came and he said we want this this this. I said this and this will take a long time the scope is huge. So he said let's begin and then see. 

They took all details for payroll. 

Took me to a kick ass steak place where I had some slow cooked pork. Amazing it was. Then they took me to best buy and bought a Mac for the work to be done on. 

I am freaking out aa some of the work is setup and I haven't done it earlier. And the app itself is vast to test. But yeah we shall see. 

I borrowed the cto's bike to come back home, man I thought I'll die before I reached home. The rules are so weird here. 

Reached home after 40 minutes of uphill cycling.

6/3/17, 12:07 PM - Vinayaka: And boards like
*Your life ain't worth what I have. Donr trespass. *

6/7/17, 5:04 PM - Vinayaka: There was one time when a new employee had joined our company. 
She was asked to delete some files, like

C\abc\a3s.pdf
C\abc\a2s.pdf
C\abc\a1s.pdf etc

She copied 
C\ to some 100 lines, and started appending the file names to that. 

I think she forgot to remove one of those c\

And deleted the whole partition. This was in production for the bank. Amex. Well, shit storm. 

They had to manually load some back up tapes to restore the lost data. 

Now you know how debts get deleted.

6/27/17, 6:06 PM - Vinayaka: Mr. Smith, a very wealthy man, is in town on business and towards the end of his trip he decides to take a walk on the docks and take in the ocean view.

As he's walking he comes up on a young boy, maybe 12 years old, crying on the edge of the dock. 

Mr. Smith hesitates but decides to ask what's wrong.

"Excuse me, Son? Why are you crying?" He asks gently.

The boy wipes away his tears and replies, "Oh, there's just a lot of things going wrong in my life right now. I'm sorry if I bothered you."

Mr. Smith takes note of the boy's politeness, "Is there anything I can do to help? Why don't you tell me what's going on..."

With that the boy breaks down and sobs. 

He starts going on and on about his troubles. 

His mother is dying of cancer and can't work. 

They can't afford the medicine to manage her symptoms. 

They haven't eaten in days. 

Not even an hour ago the boy had been caught dumpster diving behind a restaurant for food and was caned by the owner. 

He tried to go home to his mother but when he got there he saw an eviction notice on the door and he just couldn't bring himself to go inside and give her the news. 

Everything was just falling apart and he couldn't take it.

"So I came here and just cried," he finished.

Mr. Smith was shocked. 

Of all the people he could have encountered he encountered this boy. 

He could solve this boy's problems with a single check. 

But Mr. Smith was a firm believer in earning what you got no matter what it was. 

As the boy continued to cry, Mr. Smith looked out to the water...

"Son," Mr. Smith began, "What's your name?"

"My name is Johnny." The boy said.

"Johnny, you see that ship out there," he said gesturing to a ship about a mile out from the dock, "I'll make you a deal. If you can swim out to that ship, climb up the mast and wave to me I will write you a check for one million dollars."

Johnny was awestruck. "You really mean it?"

"Absolutely." Mr. Smith confirmed.

Johnny dove into the water without a word and swam like a madman. 

Mr. Smith watched with a smile on his face but his smile faded when Johnny turned around and came back. 

When Johnny reached the dock he explained he got too tired too quickly and knew he wouldn't make it.

"Well that's ok, Johnny. Tomorrow let's meet here, same time, and you can try again."

The next day they met and Johnny tried but once again he got fatigued and had to turn back. 

Mr. Smith asked him if he'd eaten anything and Johnny told him he hadn't. 

With that, Mr. Smith gave him some money for a small meal and told him tomorrow was his last day in town so if he was going to succeed it had to be then.

The next day Mr. Smith arrived and Johnny was waiting at the dock with a smile on his face. "You all fed and ready?" Mr. Smith asked.

"Yes, Sir" said Johnny. 

And Johnny dove into the water. 

This time he was swimming a bit slower. 

He seemed to be pacing himself. Mr. Smith watched Johnny get further and further and his smile grew and grew. 

What a perfect end to a perfect trip. 

He was going to make a difference in this boy's life.

Johnny made it to the ship. 

Mr. Smith watched him climb up the mast. 

Johnny held on with one hand and reached the other out and started to wave victoriously but suddenly he lost his grip! 

Johnny slipped and fell from the top of the mast all the way down to the ship below with a loud thud that echoed in the distance...

But Johnny was ok, know why?

...

...

...

...

...

He was used to hardships...

7/17/17, 8:43 AM - Vinayaka: Yeah, even I think so.
7/17/17, 8:45 AM - Vinayaka: It is usually like that. We get charged for one semester as a Spring student, as the school year is from Fall to end of Spring semester.

This time, as we are attending classes in Fall, they are making us pay for the whole semester.

Similar to our lease in Hasbrouck. Last time, the lease was till end of May. But this time the lease is till end of May again, even though we graduate in December.
7/17/17, 8:46 AM - Vinayaka: One more month of break guys. One more month to seeing same old faces and social hours :D

7/17/17, 4:08 PM - Akash Cornell: It's a good book
7/17/17, 4:09 PM - Akash Cornell: That's also Harry turtledove's specialty
7/17/17, 4:09 PM - Akash Cornell: Alternate history
7/17/17, 4:09 PM - Akash Cornell: He also had a series where the Confederates won
7/17/17, 4:12 PM - Nitish: No dude

7/17/17, 4:22 PM - Vinayaka: I hate CTB
7/17/17, 4:22 PM - Vinayaka: it is over priced
7/17/17, 4:22 PM - Vinayaka: and the food is not that good either
7/17/17, 4:22 PM - Vinayaka: MAC's serves better subs anyday

7/17/17, 7:22 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Hahaha
7/17/17, 7:28 PM - Nitish: Technically you'll still be alive even if all horcrucxes are destroyed I guess, but you're certainly weaker 😅
7/17/17, 7:34 PM - Vinayaka: Really, I thought you die when all the horcruxes are destroyed. That's why Harry kind of dies and resurrects, I didn't even get that shit. Harry was the last horocrux, right?
7/17/17, 7:36 PM - Nitish: He was one of them. But even in the end, he had to duel Voldemort even though he was not left with any horcrucxes
7/17/17, 7:54 PM - Vinayaka: Dude, that means there is one horocrux remaining right.
7/17/17, 7:54 PM - Vinayaka: Had voldemort been alive even after Harry died then it goes to prove that a man can be alive without horocruxes??
7/17/17, 8:10 PM - Ishaan Jain: This is correct
7/17/17, 8:15 PM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: One couldn't kill​ Voldemort until all the horcruxes were destroyed. Voldemort became mortal after all seven were destroyed
7/17/17, 8:16 PM - Ishaan Jain: <Media omitted>
7/17/17, 8:16 PM - Vinayaka: I don't get it. But the last book sucked. So as he killed harry, his last horocrux, he becomes mortal and then I don't know how he dies
7/17/17, 8:16 PM - Vinayaka: Shape looks stones here.
7/17/17, 8:16 PM - Vinayaka: Stoned
7/17/17, 8:17 PM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: 🤣🤣
7/17/17, 8:17 PM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: I thought he looked stoned always
7/17/17, 8:19 PM - Nitish: He uses the elderly wand on Harry which back fires because he is not it's rightful owner
7/17/17, 8:19 PM - Nitish: The last movie sucked and not the book!
7/17/17, 8:20 PM - Ishaan Jain: All this started because Voldemort thought veg biryani is actually biryani

7/26/17, 11:13 AM - Vinayaka: I am applying to it
7/26/17, 11:31 AM - Ishaan Jain: Go vini Bhai ✌🏻
7/26/17, 11:34 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Yo what is that?
7/26/17, 11:39 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Sdet Amazon
7/26/17, 11:45 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Oh awesome!
7/26/17, 12:39 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: I have a machine learning question. Need your opinion. More like a use case. Can machine learning be used to predict or detect anomalies in data? Basically if they are inconsistent/corrupted or simply deemed invalid based on some user defined rules. If so then what might be a suitable approach or tool?
7/26/17, 12:40 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: If you're looking for supervised learning then oh need to have data set labelled as corrupt and genuine data and then given a new data set you can predict if it's corrupt
7/26/17, 12:40 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Another approach can be to do unsupervised learning .. e.g. Clustering of data
7/26/17, 12:41 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Maybe k-means and check
7/26/17, 12:41 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: OK. Also assume that the data set is huge. And the incoming data to be checked is in a big data pipeline.
7/26/17, 12:41 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Not sure how accurate that can be.. unsupervised is generally not that accurate.. but might work in this case..
7/26/17, 12:41 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Single data set is huge?
7/26/17, 12:42 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I data set is huge then you've to label The huge data set
7/26/17, 12:42 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Which is pain
7/26/17, 12:42 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Yeah true
7/26/17, 12:42 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Go for unsupervised in that case I would suggest
7/26/17, 12:42 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: I that case unsupervised might be a better portion
7/26/17, 12:42 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: * option right?
7/26/17, 12:43 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I don't know other algos apart from k means
7/26/17, 12:43 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: But adjusting the params in k means must give results
7/26/17, 12:43 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Heheh yeah option
7/26/17, 12:43 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: And we can incorporate user defined rules?
7/26/17, 12:43 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Like?
7/26/17, 12:44 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Yes you can do that.. data preprocessing right?
7/26/17, 12:44 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Like no matter what classify this as crap or trash
7/26/17, 12:44 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Filter out before even applying the clustering
7/26/17, 12:44 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Exactly. But filtering will be a concern in the pipeline.
7/26/17, 12:44 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: If the filter works you're done.. else put into classifier
7/26/17, 12:44 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: But it seems like a viable option
7/26/17, 12:45 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Uhh I don't exactly get what you mean by pipeline
7/26/17, 12:45 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: It is a constant data stream in a big data pipeline
7/26/17, 12:45 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Data keeps flowing from the source
7/26/17, 12:45 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: So what? If It's a stream.. pass trough filter and then to classifier
7/26/17, 12:46 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: <Media omitted>
7/26/17, 12:47 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Won't work?
7/26/17, 12:47 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Cool I'll figure that part out 😊
7/26/17, 12:47 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I think your concern will be that classifier runs for each data set
7/26/17, 12:47 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Right?
7/26/17, 12:47 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: And not bulk
7/26/17, 12:47 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: But that's okay
7/26/17, 12:47 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: It just might.
7/26/17, 12:48 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Yeah that is a concern.
7/26/17, 12:48 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: You will never actually get your hands on the entire data set at one point in time. Instead will keep changing
7/26/17, 12:48 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Unless you're too keen on performance that should be fine I guess
7/26/17, 12:49 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: You need to have some data set in advance though
7/26/17, 12:49 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Yeah
7/26/17, 12:49 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: For you to apply ml
7/26/17, 12:49 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: That won't be an issue hopefully
7/26/17, 12:49 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Cool thank you so much sirji

7/26/17, 12:56 PM - Nitish: You might want to think if you want to use the new data to retrain your model. If not then what you ask for is fairly simple
7/26/17, 12:56 PM - Darpan Cornell: and in case you want to use scikit
7/26/17, 12:56 PM - Darpan Cornell: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.html
7/26/17, 12:56 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Oh you have python library for that too..
7/26/17, 12:56 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Yeah I just saw this one
7/26/17, 12:57 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Looks like K means with boundaries
7/26/17, 12:57 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Kernel bhi hai isme wah
7/26/17, 12:57 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Yes this is Concern. The data is bound to change
7/26/17, 12:57 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Cool will do! Thanks bhai
7/26/17, 12:57 PM - Darpan Cornell: Yes its a popular technique

7/26/17, 12:59 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Just a business case came by and I was discussing that. Till we decided we needed more insight into this problem.
7/26/17, 12:59 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: It isn't high frequency trading. But you are close. Sensitive financial data
7/26/17, 12:59 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: 👍🏻
7/26/17, 1:00 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Hahah yo!

7/26/17, 1:01 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Who made an app to detect ghosts 😂😂
7/26/17, 1:01 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: So the app has only one red button
7/26/17, 1:01 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: You press it while at any place
7/26/17, 1:02 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: And it generates random number and shows you that number.. number depicts the number of ghosts in that room/area
7/26/17, 1:02 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Funny Thing is you cant prove him wrong since you cant see ghosts
7/26/17, 1:02 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: 😂😂😂😂
7/26/17, 1:03 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: And its existence is controversial so cant argue with the model 😜😜

7/28/17, 5:30 PM - Nitish: @14256267058 is also almost 3, but given that he's Canadian, he has to have pancakes. You know, for the sake of maple syrup
7/28/17, 5:30 PM - Nitish: Of course Ankita
7/28/17, 5:36 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Heheh true!
7/28/17, 5:37 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Man the way he decided his pancakes!
7/28/17, 5:37 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I couldn't stop but keep on staring 😂
7/28/17, 6:31 PM - Nitish: You are 3/4 and accidentally ate pork vegetarian

7/28/17, 7:07 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Its OK kanji
7/28/17, 8:06 PM - Nitish: This means that u ate pork and liked it as much as vegetarian food
7/28/17, 9:14 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Bichari

7/28/17, 9:44 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Nice title!
7/29/17, 5:42 PM - Nitish: Leetcode competition !!
7/29/17, 6:15 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Oye did you guys know about the uber event that happened 2 weeks ago?
7/29/17, 6:17 PM - Darpan Cornell: Which uber event?
7/29/17, 6:20 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Don't know much. Just know that there was one in bay area 2 days ago
7/29/17, 6:20 PM - Nitish: Nope...we didn't know

7/29/17, 7:51 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Isn't it 2?
7/29/17, 8:02 PM - Nitish: All leaves are duplicates if they have same value and u can have 3 diff combinations of the leaves for your tree
7/29/17, 8:35 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Got it. They form more duplicate sub trees nonetheless. I'm guessing we are only counting them once as per the description
7/29/17, 8:42 PM - Nitish: Yeah, for each duplicate couple, you count one
7/29/17, 10:22 PM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: How was today's contest people ?
7/29/17, 10:23 PM - Nitish: Quite difficult I'd say 😅 I was only able to solve 2nd question
7/29/17, 10:24 PM - Akash Cornell: Finished first two, couldn't finish third
7/29/17, 10:51 PM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Hmm. . Oki
7/29/17, 10:51 PM - Nitish: Did you participate?
7/29/17, 10:52 PM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Nope.. Had to go out
7/29/17, 10:54 PM - Nitish: 👍🏻

7/30/17, 10:02 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-4760‬: 😮
7/30/17, 10:37 AM - Vinayaka: Some friend of friend
7/30/17, 10:39 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Don't question Vinayakas stalking skills. . 😐
7/30/17, 10:40 AM - Nitish: More details *****
7/30/17, 12:59 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-4760‬: 😅
7/30/17, 5:35 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Whoa!
7/30/17, 7:29 PM - Darpan Cornell: <Media omitted>
7/30/17, 7:30 PM - Ishaan Jain: So, will Jamie say - "ya ya ya"?
7/30/17, 7:43 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-4760‬: 😓😓🤦‍♀
7/31/17, 8:10 AM - Nitish: I got a TA position for CS 1110 intro to python taught by "Walker White" 🤣
7/31/17, 8:24 AM - Vinayaka: Awesome.
7/31/17, 8:29 AM - Akash Cornell: Good stuff
7/31/17, 8:41 AM - Akash Cornell: You mentioned you didn't want to take it though?
7/31/17, 8:41 AM - Akash Cornell: I would recommend taking it, I don't think it will be that much of a time commitment, especially for the lower level courses where there will be twenty or more ta's
7/31/17, 9:04 AM - Nitish: But first I have to obviously check his LinkedIn profile to see if he is the Night King! I don't want to work for just any walker beyond the wall
7/31/17, 9:16 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: 🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀
7/31/17, 9:16 AM - Akash Cornell: Oh lol
7/31/17, 9:17 AM - Akash Cornell: I saw Walter white
7/31/17, 9:17 AM - Akash Cornell: And thought you were making a breaking bad reference
7/31/17, 9:17 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: On the contrary, counting past TA recollections, they said lower level courses take more effort because the students don't know anything. Even the basics. TA for a high level course have a comparatively easier time given that students need to have a basic working knowledge already and just need a little guidance. That's all.
7/31/17, 9:22 AM - Akash Cornell: Diffused responsibility
7/31/17, 9:23 AM - Akash Cornell: Overall they need more effort
7/31/17, 9:23 AM - Akash Cornell: But you individually won't have to do as much right?
7/31/17, 9:38 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Well the classes are significantly bigger. Student to instructor ratio is much higher
7/31/17, 9:40 AM - Akash Cornell: There will be some 700 students in 2110, with say 30 tas
7/31/17, 9:41 AM - Akash Cornell: 300 in os, with around 10 tas (fewer who did anything)
7/31/17, 9:41 AM - Akash Cornell: Still feel like upper year classes are more painful to ta
7/31/17, 9:41 AM - Akash Cornell: Either way
7/31/17, 9:41 AM - Akash Cornell: They are not no work at all :)
7/31/17, 9:44 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Probably. Anyway I didn't TA prior to this. But I'll get a similar experience baby sitting the next batch for the Docket Wrench project at LII😅
7/31/17, 9:44 AM - Vinayaka: 🙏
7/31/17, 9:45 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Yes. Already breaking my head trying to understand the code 😓
7/31/17, 9:57 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
7/31/17, 10:00 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: According to my roommate its more painful to TA for a pure Undergrad course... They are clueless and bug you a lot...
7/31/17, 10:02 AM - Akash Cornell: I've ta'd at my previous school, nothing more painful than having to manage a lab
7/31/17, 10:02 AM - Akash Cornell: At least here, you can restrict it to your office hours
7/31/17, 10:03 AM - Akash Cornell: And some marking
7/31/17, 10:03 AM - Akash Cornell: There, I had to deal with all the newbies trying to do agile development when they didn't even know what the word meant ><
7/31/17, 10:03 AM - Akash Cornell: This will be a breeze compared to that
7/31/17, 10:04 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: I meant this 👆🏻😃
7/31/17, 10:04 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Not really. You have to be active on Piazza
7/31/17, 10:06 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: And you will be personally involved in designing assignments. So will have to take lead on those assignments as well. At least that's how it is in higher level classes.
7/31/17, 10:28 AM - Akash Cornell: Not for lower level classes though
7/31/17, 10:28 AM - Akash Cornell: And that's my point haha
7/31/17, 10:28 AM - Akash Cornell: Piazza is Piazza, you can do it during your office hours or something
7/31/17, 11:07 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Ok. Nitish you have to TA for 1110 and put this debate to rest 🙏🏼
7/31/17, 11:11 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: He's got his own concerns. About night king and what not.
7/31/17, 11:17 AM - Nitish: Do I have to TA or just make any decision about it to put it to rest?
7/31/17, 11:18 AM - Nitish: At least I have some real concerns. You guys are just like Cersei and Danerys worrying about childlike problems!
7/31/17, 11:21 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5873‬: Lol Nithish has become John snow!
7/31/17, 11:25 AM - Nitish: And I know nothing 😂
7/31/17, 11:56 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Kya se kya kar diya discussion ka🤦🏽‍♀
7/31/17, 11:58 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: True that! You think veg pulao is Biryani! 🤣
7/31/17, 11:59 AM - Nitish: @13142037957 now if that's changing topics, what do you say to this?
7/31/17, 11:59 AM - Ishaan Jain: <Media omitted>
7/31/17, 12:00 PM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: He is tripping on something
7/31/17, 12:54 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: 😂 supa hot fire
7/31/17, 1:09 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: What if we miss that TA training thing ?
7/31/17, 1:11 PM - Nitish: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY9R0YeGKGQ
7/31/17, 1:11 PM - Nitish: stop whatever you're doing and watch that!
7/31/17, 1:12 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: You overwrote my question. 😏
7/31/17, 1:12 PM - Nitish: Trust me it's not important.
7/31/17, 1:22 PM - Akash Cornell: There's another session on August 26 or something
7/31/17, 1:32 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Okk
7/31/17, 1:34 PM - Nitish: To clarify, I said your question wasn't important compared to the video, not that the training wasn't important
7/31/17, 1:35 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Hahaha
7/31/17, 1:35 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I see
7/31/17, 2:01 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5873‬: When is the training!?
7/31/17, 2:02 PM - Akash Cornell: Didn't your professor or Stephanie send an email to you on this?
7/31/17, 2:02 PM - Darpan Cornell: Sindhura and Ankita, which courses are you TA for?
7/31/17, 2:04 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5873‬: Ai

8/1/17, 9:10 AM - Akash Cornell: It's the denouement phase now
8/1/17, 9:21 AM - Vinayaka: He he, true true.
8/1/17, 9:22 AM - Nitish: Less than 3 weeks and I'm just holding onto that thought 😅
8/1/17, 9:38 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Did you talk to your team mates?
8/1/17, 10:06 AM - Nitish: No but I have a Chinese intern guy in the next team to hang out with😅
8/1/17, 8:23 PM - Akash Cornell: We made saag
8/1/17, 8:24 PM - Akash Cornell: At first, I just tasted spinach

8/2/17, 7:08 AM - Vinayaka: @14256267058 when are you flying back? Is anyone coming from New York city, or is everyone flying directly to Ithaca. ??
8/2/17, 7:09 AM - Akash Cornell: Ayswarya and I are on the same flight
8/2/17, 7:09 AM - Akash Cornell: 6am to New York
8/2/17, 7:09 AM - Akash Cornell: Taking the bus from there
8/2/17, 7:09 AM - Akash Cornell: When does your plane land in NYC?
8/2/17, 7:11 AM - Vinayaka: 19th?
8/2/17, 7:11 AM - Akash Cornell: Yep
8/2/17, 7:11 AM - Akash Cornell: The Saturday
8/2/17, 7:12 AM - Vinayaka: I reach at 1.
8/2/17, 7:12 AM - Akash Cornell: I think we reach at 2 ish?
8/2/17, 7:12 AM - Ishaan Jain: So many engineers triggered in comments
8/2/17, 7:12 AM - Vinayaka: Okie. Let me check once again what the time of arrival is
8/2/17, 7:14 AM - Akash Cornell: We arrive at 3
8/2/17, 7:14 AM - Akash Cornell: Just checked
8/2/17, 7:16 AM - Akash Cornell: That Facebook post is too much haha
8/2/17, 7:43 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: taking offence is in fashion now..
8/2/17, 8:41 AM - Vinayaka: I will be arriving at 1 pm. So I can wait at the airport or near port authority. What do you suggest??
8/2/17, 8:53 AM - Akash Cornell: Depends on where we want to get food
8/2/17, 8:53 AM - Akash Cornell: How are you getting from airport to Port authority?
8/2/17, 8:53 AM - Akash Cornell: Since there are three of us, might even be cheaper to take a cab instead of that shuttle thing
8/2/17, 9:14 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Why do you all book to NYC ?
8/2/17, 9:15 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: How much of a difference does it make ?
8/2/17, 9:18 AM - Vinayaka: Like 150 dollars.
8/2/17, 9:19 AM - Vinayaka: The subway??
8/2/17, 9:19 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: And how much do you spend on food+transit to port authority+ticket to Ithaca
8/2/17, 9:19 AM - Akash Cornell: O.o there's a Subway connecting them?
8/2/17, 9:19 AM - Akash Cornell: Didn't know that
8/2/17, 9:19 AM - Vinayaka: Reduce 50 dollars for the bus to Ithaca commute.
8/2/17, 9:20 AM - Akash Cornell: My worry was that the flights to Ithaca are always overbooked
8/2/17, 9:20 AM - Akash Cornell: So there is a chance it'll get cancelled
8/2/17, 9:20 AM - Vinayaka: Yeah. I thought of that. Next time onwards definitely Ithaca direct.
8/2/17, 9:20 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Well if i get bumped off my flight I'll be at Newark👍🏼
8/2/17, 9:21 AM - Akash Cornell: Haha
8/2/17, 9:21 AM - Akash Cornell: Bus will be super busy too ><
8/2/17, 9:21 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Oops. . My connection is at Philly
8/2/17, 9:22 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Not NJ
8/2/17, 9:38 AM - Nitish: Next time uh 😳
8/2/17, 9:38 AM - Nitish: Bumped off ur flight? 😳
8/2/17, 9:39 AM - ‪+1 (314) 203-7957‬: Yea. . If it's overbooked then
8/2/17, 9:40 AM - Nitish: I don't understand this overbooking... people book in advance right?
8/2/17, 9:59 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Did you guys book bus?
8/2/17, 10:00 AM - Akash Cornell: Yep
8/2/17, 10:00 AM - Akash Cornell: And for overbooking, it's cause they want money
8/2/17, 10:01 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: There an AirTrain
8/2/17, 10:01 AM - Akash Cornell: So they usually assume like 20% of the passengers don't show
8/2/17, 10:01 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Which leaves JFK. But you have to change 2 or 3 times before you reach PABT
8/2/17, 10:02 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Nope. 1 air train and 1 normal train
8/2/17, 10:02 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Only one stop at Jamaica
8/2/17, 10:02 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: *change

8/2/17, 10:05 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Oh yeah! You should know where you are going. I once got into the train on the wrong side.
8/2/17, 10:10 AM - Vinayaka: Not yet. Will book now. They add more buses when the summer end/begins. They know there will be more commuters.
8/2/17, 10:13 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: Oh yeah va.
8/2/17, 10:14 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: I didn't think about newyork traffic before booking flight. Looks like I'll reach Ithaca only at 11 in the night

8/2/17, 11:47 AM - Vinayaka: Of course.
8/2/17, 11:48 AM - Vinayaka: But it cannot be in work, I guess
8/2/17, 11:51 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: In work?
8/2/17, 11:52 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Am getting free trip so I thought why not! 😜
8/2/17, 12:17 PM - Vinayaka: I don't think you can.
8/2/17, 12:18 PM - Vinayaka: That's not legal. And your cpt will not go beyond college start date if I am correct.
8/2/17, 12:18 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Am nt working there

8/2/17, 12:25 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Agar puchna hi hai to isso ko puchungi.. Stephanie doesn't know anything about visa and cpt. But why do I need to ask?
8/2/17, 12:25 PM - Vinayaka: Abey

8/2/17, 1:58 PM - Vinayaka: Jai ho storm and Paris ki
8/2/17, 2:19 PM - Nitish: And why are they sending you?
8/2/17, 2:20 PM - Nitish: Have you considered the possibility of Trump actually building that wall and you getting stuck on the other side?
8/2/17, 2:33 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Hahah lol
8/2/17, 2:33 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: In 3 days?
8/2/17, 2:38 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: To show me the place! 😬
8/2/17, 2:39 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: They gave an offer but they know we will be reluctant to go there so they're first giving me the tour to check if I like it there
8/2/17, 2:53 PM - Nitish: 😱 you should have led with this. Congrats 👍🏻
8/2/17, 2:53 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: ??
8/2/17, 2:53 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Haha thanks.. although not if much use

8/2/17, 4:19 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: The least you could do is hook up Vini Bhai with a Brazilian chick 😜
8/2/17, 4:19 PM - Vinayaka: Amen to that.
8/2/17, 4:57 PM - Nitish: Thats the last that she needs to do, given the hooking up he's doing already!
8/2/17, 5:03 PM - Vinayaka: Dey, you are fake news.
8/2/17, 5:04 PM - Vinayaka: <Media omitted>
8/2/17, 5:09 PM - Nitish: Science and Global warming are not fake Mr.President!
8/2/17, 5:21 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Hahah truebthat!
8/2/17, 5:22 PM - Vinayaka: Mera naam badnaam kar rahe ho

8/2/17, 5:27 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Guys
8/2/17, 5:27 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: If you want to use face recognition with ability to register new users
8/2/17, 5:27 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: What would you use?
8/2/17, 5:27 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I mean which ML algo?
8/3/17, 7:50 AM - Vinayaka: Where do we check gpa??
8/3/17, 7:50 AM - Vinayaka: On student center, I know, but where though.
8/3/17, 7:51 AM - Ishaan Jain: Grades drop-down
8/3/17, 8:04 AM - Nitish: Knn 😬
8/3/17, 8:04 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Anything apart from that?
8/3/17, 8:05 AM - Nitish: Convnet
8/3/17, 8:05 AM - Nitish: And obviously u know that...so u should specifically ask Darpan and Ishaan if they have any other answers
8/3/17, 8:05 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Haha
8/3/17, 8:06 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Hmm.. let them reply
8/3/17, 8:06 AM - Nitish: But why not knn or convnet?
8/3/17, 8:14 AM - Vinayaka: Okie.
8/3/17, 10:01 AM - Vinayaka: <Media omitted>
8/3/17, 10:03 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-4760‬: 😂😂
8/3/17, 10:14 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-0693‬: 🤣
8/3/17, 10:17 AM - Vinayaka: Yeah, that's what my dad would have done too
8/3/17, 10:17 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Well knn will be slow for huge data
8/3/17, 10:18 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Convnet you'll have to train again for new data set right?
8/3/17, 11:37 AM - Nitish: Good luck escaping that 😅👍🏻
8/3/17, 11:44 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: I think some platforms come with this functionality and libraries included. You can simply implement it or add your logic to it.
8/3/17, 11:44 AM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Assuming you don't want to build it from scratch
8/3/17, 12:22 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: What libraries?
8/3/17, 12:22 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I mean what algo do they use?
8/3/17, 12:24 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: I worked with OpenCV
8/3/17, 12:25 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Okk
8/3/17, 12:25 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I'll check
8/3/17, 12:25 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: They have libraries which use different algorithms. You can specify which one you want to use
8/3/17, 12:26 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Ok
8/3/17, 12:26 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Need to check algo
8/3/17, 12:26 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I want algo
8/3/17, 12:26 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Implementing won't be difficult
8/3/17, 12:26 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I gues a
8/3/17, 12:27 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: It is open sourced. I'm sure you'll find it somewhere. Open CV has been getting a lot of support and development.
8/3/17, 12:29 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Yep..
8/3/17, 12:30 PM - Vinayaka: meri jawaani mein I had used opencv to do some image processing :)
8/3/17, 12:31 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Haha haan piraña hai kaafi
8/3/17, 12:31 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: I don't like it much
8/3/17, 12:31 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Kyuki ata nhi 😜😜😜
8/3/17, 12:31 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Mainly
8/3/17, 12:31 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: And then it's more made for c++
8/3/17, 12:32 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Now a days they have python libraries too
8/3/17, 12:32 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: C++ is the key to make it execute fast
8/3/17, 12:32 PM - Vinayaka: we tried doing a project with drone and landing it.
8/3/17, 12:32 PM - Vinayaka: we started with python
8/3/17, 12:33 PM - Vinayaka: kaafi slow tha
8/3/17, 12:33 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: There are many wrappers as you said. But not as efficient as the original OpenCV in C
8/3/17, 12:33 PM - Vinayaka: we moved to C++ eventually
8/3/17, 12:33 PM - Vinayaka: I think its interpreted vs compiled code comparision. Probably garbage collection too??
8/3/17, 12:34 PM - ‪+1 (646) 334-0520‬: Yep. You'll have to be very very efficient in terms of managing memory as well. A single memory leak at that scale of data will crash your app in no time
8/3/17, 12:37 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Yeah and that's why they do aot for such devices
8/3/17, 12:37 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: Btw isso replied @16072793784
8/3/17, 12:37 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: They said no issues
8/3/17, 12:42 PM - Nitish: Have fun at Brazil then!

8/3/17, 6:58 PM - Vinayaka: varamahalakshmi habba is the day we offer speacial prayers to goddess lakshmi to bless our family
8/3/17, 6:58 PM - Vinayaka: Yeah
8/3/17, 7:00 PM - Vinayaka: Its a major festival in Karnataka
8/3/17, 7:00 PM - Vinayaka: Varamahalakshmi Vrata is a festival to propitiate the goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu, one of the Hindu Trinity. Varalakshmi is one who grants boons (Varam). It is an important pooja performed by many women in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The Hindu festival going by the name 'Vara maha Lakshmi Vrata' is celebrated on the Second Friday or the Friday before full moon day - Poornima in the month of Śravaṇā, also called Śawan in Hindi and Aadi in Tamil which corresponds to the Gregorian months of July–August.
Varamahalakshmi Vrata is performed by married woman for the well being of all the family members, especially husband, to get progeny etc. It is believed that worshiping Goddess Varalakshmi on this day is equivalent to worshiping Ashtalaksmi – the eight goddesses of Wealth, Earth, Learning, Love, Fame, Peace, Pleasure, and Strength. Because of the popularity in some states of India, it is declared as an optional official holiday in India
8/3/17, 7:01 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: hahah

8/3/17, 7:19 PM - Darpan Cornell: <Media omitted>
8/3/17, 7:19 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5873‬: Except for this 😜

8/3/17, 7:26 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: hehe
8/3/17, 7:30 PM - Darpan Cornell: Convnet should be the ideal one. What you should do is apply segmentation before so that you can get faces out of the images and then pass through Convnet
8/3/17, 7:31 PM - Darpan Cornell: That is how ML pipelines for facial recognition work these days

Anecdote for no use
8/4/17, 8:59 AM - Vinayaka: If you are getting offended, then you are a sexist.
Why would Serena want to say such a thing? She is a good tennis player, but why compare between the sexes. Its just sexist on her part.
8/4/17, 9:01 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5873‬: I feel that's an biased interpretation
8/4/17, 9:04 AM - Vinayaka: and the bias is toward??
8/4/17, 9:08 AM - Vinayaka: did people not rub it in the face when they said that serena won the trophy playing when she was pregnant. Isn't that flaunting??
8/4/17, 9:09 AM - Vinayaka: If you are okie with that and not okie with this, then you are not only a sexist, but also a hypocrite
8/4/17, 9:09 AM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5873‬: U are assuming that the society is unbiased and blaming Serena alone for the challenge she proposed.. 
U aren't getting the point what made her to challenge that way

8/4/17, 12:33 PM - ‪+1 (607) 279-5683‬: That's what I don't like the new features.. too much of dependence..
